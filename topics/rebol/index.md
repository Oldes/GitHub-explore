Rebol (Relative Expression-Based Object Language) is a lightweight, cross-platform programming and data exchange language designed by Carl Sassenrath, known for its unique concept of "dialects"â€”domain-specific mini-languages optimized for specific tasks. It combines multiple paradigms, including functional, imperative, and prototype-based programming, and emphasizes simplicity and expressiveness. Rebol is homoiconic, meaning code and data share the same structure, enabling seamless manipulation of both.
